// This module handles the communication between the software and the drone
// including sending commands to the drone and receiving telemetry data from it.
//
// The communication module's main responsibilities are:
// - Managing the transmission of commands from the software to the drone.
// - Receiving and processing data sent from the drone back to the software.
// - Ensuring reliable and efficient communication protocols are used.

    // Fields for managing communication
