## Thermal

"thermal camera minefield"
"infrared imaging mines"
"thermal imagery landmine"
"thermal view of minefield"
"infrared camera mine detection"
"thermal imaging unexploded ordnance"
"landmine detection thermal"
"thermal drone minefield"
"infrared survey mine area"
"thermal scan for mines"
"heat imaging mine exploration"
"thermal camera military mines"
"infrared minefield survey"
"thermal imaging demining"
"landmine thermal mapping"
"thermal sensor mines"
"infrared technology in mine detection"
"thermal imaging in minefields"
"infrared camera for mine detection"
"thermal detection of unexploded ordnance"

There is a lot of overlap between the two, so we can use the same keywords for both. The only difference is that we can use "thermal" for the thermal images and "visual" for the visual images.
